        <p>
            Hello! My name is Lucy Wangui, and I am currently learning web development.
            I enjoy turning ideas into websites and solving problems using code.
            Every day I challenge myself to learn something new in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>
            What makes me unique is my curiosity and determination.
            Even when things get confusing, I keep practicing until I understand.
            My goal is to become a skilled developer and build projects that make a real impact.
